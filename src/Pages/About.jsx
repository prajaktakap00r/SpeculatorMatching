          CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing
          CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect
          immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place
          over a period of time. For example, if you change the color of an
          element from white to black, usually the change is instantaneous. With
          CSS transitions enabled, changes occur at time intervals that follow
          an acceleration curve, all of which can be customized. CSS transitions
